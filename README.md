# ECSE-202-Assignments
This repo contains solutions to Java assignments in ECSE 202 for the Winter 2022 session. You will need the ACM library to run these projects. Feel Free to reach out for more details.


# Assignments Overview

## Assignment 1) Base2Base
The objective of this assignment is to learn how to write a simple Java program that uses a simple text-based interface to communicate
with a user. Specifically, this program, Base2Base, will read in a text string representing a positive decimal integer expressed in a
base from [2,16], and then convert it to a number in a user-specified base.

## Assignment 2) B-Trees and Sorting
In this assignment, we will explore the B-Tree data structure for use in data storage, specifically the use of its order property in a sorting application. Similar to Assignment 1, text is read a line at a time using readLine (acm) or nextLine (scanner)
until a blank line is encountered. As a use case, you will write a program to input a list of names and render it in both ascending **(inorder traversal)** and descending **(post-order traversal)** sort order.

## Assignment 3) Application of Stacks and Queues: Expression Parsing
This assignment is a prelude to Assignment 4, where you will design and implement a calculator applet. The goal of this assignment is to create a class called postFix **(The Shunting-yard Algorithm)** which contains methods that implement infix to postfix conversion, and a test class called In2p which reads an input expression from the user and prints the resulting postfix expression.

## Assignment 4) Building a Simple Calculator
In the previous assignment, you wrote a Java program that prompted the user for an infix expression and converted the result to postfix, displaying the result in the console window. In this assignment, you will i) build a simple interpreter that takes the postfix result as input and returns the numerical value of the expression as output, and ii) build a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) to this interpreter that functions as a simple calculator.

## Assignment 5) Porting A2 from Java to C
re-implementing assignment 2 in C and object-oriented programming.
